### Hi there üëã

I'm a full-stack software engineer with 10+ years experience and a huge passion for Open Source... [Full Bio](https://resume.ulisesgascon.com/)

My current open source activity is highly focused on the JS ecosystem. I have dedicated my time to maintaining and contributing to [over 120 open source packages](https://www.npmjs.com/~ulisesgascon), including some of the top 100 packages on the Npm registry.
